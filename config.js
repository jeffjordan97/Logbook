						<strong>Morning</strong>: <br /> 
						<strong>9am</strong>: Met with Lucy Rogers, the current intern on the content team at Shop Direct. She gave me a brief 
						tour around the building, and we sorted out my pass to provide access in/out of the building.<br />
						<strong>11am</strong>: Welcomed to the content team, introduced to everyone in the team, attempting to recall everyone’s name.<br />
						Spent time with Lucy, who talked over Very, Littlewoods, and the services they offer/use. 
						Introduced to different software and websites used to manage all services. This involved: <br />
						-	Schedule: business as usual (BAU) schedule, delegation of updates required to Very, LW, and LWI.<br />
						-	BCC: eCommerce tool, including management of code (stored, used at staging, used on live site).<br />
						-	SharePoint: document store, containing weekly web updates, used to confirm completion of jobs from the BAU schedule. Also includes overtime log.<br />
						-	Trello: workflow management tool, used for contingency and asset removal.<br />
						-	Fuse: material design for website.<br />
						-	Corporate: intranet of the organisation, used to access additional services such as HR, Shine (rewards system).<br />
						-	Outlook: already familiar with outlook emailing software, but was introduced to calendar tool (& how it can be used effectively).<br />
						-	Excel Online: document store for briefs, weekly updates, training schedule etc.<br />
						<strong>Afternoon</strong>:<br />
						<strong>2pm</strong>: Shadowed Lucy as she talked through several simple tasks – creating new projects on the BCC, altering HTML code to switch out new images 
						(e.g. on the Littlewoods Ireland (LWI) kids zone page), then approving the stages to deploy staging (identical sites replicating the live sites).<br />
						<strong>First Day Overview</strong>:<br />
						Informative day, packed with new information about Very and the way in which they operate. No inductions occurred on the first day, which allowed me to spend 
						more time getting to know the team, which I preferred. I also enjoyed having lunch with the new interns, getting to know them and discussing the teams they are all working in.

						<strong>2pm</strong>: Completed required legislation walkthroughs concerning information and security, located on the ‘Talent Online’ page on the corporate intranet.<br />
						<strong>Day Overview</strong>:<br />
						Gained more first-hand experience working with the BCC, creating a project to locate HTML code for a certain area of a page, then performing changes to deploy to staging. 
						Again, I had lunch with the new interns, getting to know more about each of their interests. Overall, a productive day, gaining a further understanding of software in use, 
						as well as getting to know the content team.

						<strong>Morning</strong>: <br />
						<strong>8.30am</strong>: Began work on updating the Very C&F Women’s curve landing page, given a slice guide (example display/layout of the page) and brief for the task. 
						I first began swapping out image paths, to which I noticed several assets did not exactly match the slice guide, requiring that I email the creative team to updates the assets. 
						Access to images is provided through Versions software (also known as SVN), a document-management system. <br />
						<strong>11am</strong>: Catch-up meeting with Matt Wafer, discussing my experience during the first two days. A clear area of progression was identified to be my understanding 
						of the terminology used at Shop Direct, taking it upon myself to make notes throughout the day as I begin to hear new terms. <br />
						<strong>Afternoon</strong>:<br />
						<strong>1pm</strong>: Continued work on the Very C&F women’s curve webpage.<br />
						<strong>2pm</strong>: Meeting with Phil Bryan, discussing the search tool used on the Very website, displaying the importance of understanding customer search query techniques and patterns.<br />
						<strong>4pm</strong>: Meeting with Louise Utton and the other interns to discuss our current experience so far working for Shop Direct, including what we most and least enjoy about our roles.<br />
						<strong>Day Overview</strong>:<br />
						Productive day, given more freedom to work on the Very C&F women’s curve page without guidance. This allowed me to ask any questions throughout the day whenever I came across 
						a problem. I also enjoyed sitting in on the meeting with Mike, as it helped me understand how workload is assigned from other departments to the content team, and how disputes 
						can be settled if the workload is too excessive for the content team to handle in one week, as essential jobs become prioritised.

						I had previously not spoken to. Also improved my understanding of how updates are managed/performed through scheduling and using the BCC.

						<strong>Day Overview</strong>:<br />
						Productive day, primarily work driven, with a focus on the Very/LW/LWI C&F women’s curves landing page. Although updates to the desktop version were complete relatively quickly, 
						the mobile version brought about my first challenging task at Shop Direct. Given heavy workload towards other members of the team, this led to a slight build-up of pressure, 
						with the goal of resolving overflowing tasks on Monday morning before updates were pushed live.

				BAU (business as usual) updates, specifically to Littlewoods Ireland, with the idea to start the Brand Boutique landing page. This not only helped me to further understand the processes behind BAU updates, but also allowed for additional time to work on my 
				coding skills. A main learning focus this week was towards time management and attention to detail, as with so many small updates occurring at one time, 
				the awareness required to reduce the possibility of error was increased drastically.`,

						<br /><strong>Afternoon</strong>: <br />
						For lunch I enjoyed a buffet-style lunch with the team I had been placed in for the day.<br />
						The afternoon mainly consisted of team-based exercises similar to that of the TV show 'The Apprentice', whereby each team was given a list of tasks to gain points,

						To end the day at Avenue HQ, there was an awards ceremony to provide gifts to the winners of the challenge. individual staff were also presented with awards in

						I found this away day to be a great way of getting to know other people around the business that I had not previously spoken to. The team-building exercises were

						Introduced to Supplier Funded team and the process of how they perform updates. The Supplier Funded updates are located 
						at the bottom of the schedule, with the inital view that there are fewer updates on a weekly basis than BAU. 
						The process of performing an update for the Supplier Funded team involves copying the Job ID from the schedule and searching for
						this task on Trello, given the Job ID should be been assigned to a card. After all comments (containing links, asset paths etc.) 
						have been read over, you update the page through the BCC similarly to BAU. Once complete and up on staging, the progress of the 
						job can be updated in the schedule, and the individual managing the project from the Threefold agency can be made aware the 
						update is ready for sign off. Once signed off, this can then be pushed live when necessary, usually as soon as possible, however 
						sometimes may be with a specific date/time. <br />
						Following this introduction, I performed amends to the Russell Hobbs brand store page for both Very and LW, desktop & mobile.

						Finished off home & zone updates for 30/08. Found to be a quicker/easier process than previous,

						<br /><strong>Afternoon</strong><br />
						Began building the Kate Spade brand store page for desktop. I found this build to be relatively 
						easy, writing code with the BEM methodology in mind to improve easy of reading. Given the Kate Spade 
						landing page did not have an existing page in the BCC, this required a creating new 4thway pages 
						across all brands. This was the first time I was able to fully create a new landing page with several 
						pieces of functionality (sliders/videos) without assistance from the team. I began the page build by
						taking a duplicate from women’s new arrivals page, therefore saving time copying in the styles for the brand 
						store. However, after building the page, I was made aware for the 30/08 update that the Kate spade LW/LWI 
						versions were not going to be pushed live, as requested by the brand, meaning part of my proejct was redundant.
						<br /><strong>Daily Overview</strong><br />
						Enjoyable process creating the Kate Spade landing page, especially since I built this alone. However, changes 
						requested by the brand at the last minute are a clear indication of the dynamic environment I work in, given 
						the project for LW/LWI was cancelled as the brand requested not to have products sold on these sites. 
						Even though the creation of these pages was a copy-paste task from that built on Very, it was still required 
						to create the pages in the BCC for both desktop & mobile, a process itself that takes up time that could 
						have been spent on other projects.

						-	Unlocking emotion – the science of emotions in advertising.<br />
						-	Plugging in the right people and technology – Spencer Hudson, Global Technical Solutions manager, 
						discussed the transformation of the ecommerce landscape, and how getting the right people and technology 
						together is key to delivering successful customer outcomes.<br />
						-	Intelligent future: human habits, behaviours, and phenomenon’s and what they mean for brands – Dr 
						Hannah Fry discussed the use of data gathering to discover patterns in human tendencies around social 
						issues, from human relationships to urban crime.<br />
						-	Human-centred experiences: operational considerations which drive buying decisions. Questioning 
						whether the smartphone has begun to reign over our individual ability to be creative, and whether the 
						proliferation of technology is having an adverse impact on emotional wellbeing.<br />
						-	Understanding generation z<br />
						I found the first day to be very productive, speaking to several businesses about what they do,

						used with Asos checkout, and Sorted, a delivery service improving the efficiency of service.<br />
						The second day at the retail week event was structured similarly, attending several talks throughout

						the processes when sending emails to larger groups of people, as well as helping improve the formality of my emails.<br />
						During the afternoon we all said goodbye to Lucy, as she left to return to uni. During the little time I had to work with 
						her, she was extremely helpful and understanding upon my arrival at Shop Direct, having been in the situation the previous 
						year. She provided me with a significant amount of help throughout the first month as I began learning HTML and CSS in 
						further detail, and I really appreciated all the time she spent sat with me to run through the processes of updates.<br />
						After having a short discussion with Matt Wafer, I learned a lot about the importance of specificity in CSS, and how this 
						is used when writing code to improve the understandability of code and help target elements generally or more direct. This 
						helps to figure out issues with conflicting CSS, such as why it is preferred to not use important tags as they can’t be 
						overridden, therefore complicating code.

						on the schedule to complete the Ideal Home landing page, and that I was only to have 
						added in the cell on the Home hub, meaning that my version of the Exotic Florals landing 
						page was a duplicate and therefore wouldn’t be used to go live. This happened because

						to the Home page, gifts zone, women’s zone, men’s zone and sports zone pages for desktop & mobile, 
						including updates to the top navigation imagery. 
						<br /><strong>Afternoon</strong><br / >
						During the afternoon, Jill asked me to pick up a task for financial services (FS), involving 
						changes to the insurance pages on the money zone on Very and Littlewoods, specifically adding in a 
						new cell to link through to the new IPID terms below the FS T&Cs. This process took slightly longer 
						than usual tasks of a similar page weight (as recorded in the schedule) due to the FS pages being 
						built externally, where the code structure was different to that developed by the content team.<br/ >
						After contacting Rachel Evans, the point of contact from FS Insurance to let her know that the update 
						was ready to be pushed live, she asked if I could also update the T&Cs linked through from the insurance 
						pages. <br />
						Following this, she also notified me that the home insurance offered by Very and Littlewoods was currently 
						unavailable and so customers should not be able to enquire for a quote. I therefore removed the ‘get a quote’ 
						button from the home insurance page.<br />
						After liaising with other staff, she asked if I could rebuild the home insurance page to go live Sunday night 
						when the IPID terms were to be updated. I then spent the rest of the afternoon building the home insurance 
						page for both desktop & mobile. Although this wasn’t a large build, the pressure to provide staging links 
						by the end of the day was high, therefore it was required that I act quickly. After staying behind for over 
						an hour to complete the builds, I was able to send over the staging links. Further amends were required by 
						Rachel to hide access to the T&Cs, which I acted upon when arriving home after contacting her through email. 
						I scheduled the project as requested, to go live on Sunday at 11pm. I also spent time on Sunday night checking 
						that the pages had gone live successfully, to which they had. As mentioned, although the workload was lower 
						than usual, the time restrictions and pressure to complete gave the build more weight. Following this, I found 
						out Rachel had contacted my senior manager at the time, Gareth Naser, giving very positive feedback about myself 
						and Jill. I very much appreciated the kind words she had to say, and as a result Gareth chose to give me his 
						shine points for the month as a thank you for my efforts.

						This afternoon I had a meeting with Lucie Farrington, the intern in the UX team, to discuss both 
						our areas of work. I provided help with her webpage design project, describing the basics of HTML

						told me about the UX teams and squads they are involved in, including the roles and responsibilities 
						of UX researchers, who provide ideas and organise labs to gather feedback, as well as designers who 
						develop ideas into designs and visual prototypes. Lucie also made me aware of a few meetings/events 
						that occur in the squads that I have not yet experienced. CoP meetings, standing for community of 
						practice, are discussions for new ideas and changes to user experiences, a form of improving their 
						agile ways of working. Design sprints are a way of working in the squads, where specific goals 
						are implemented in a 2-week period.
						<br /><strong>Daily Overview</strong><br / >
						During my meeting with Lucie, I found it interesting to see the work she has done since starting 
						placement, explaining how the UX researchers work, hence why the sitewide changes they implement 
						can take a long time to implement, as well as the additional time for development and testing to 
						produce a functioning solution. Personally, I don’t think the area of UX is of most interest to me, 
						simply due to the speed of updates, taking a long time to implement such small changes. Although 
						I like the idea of researching to improve the look and feel of the website, I don’t think I’d be 
						best suited to the speed of implementation, as my current role allows me to provide updates much 
						quicker, in some cases instantly, with the route of a frontend development role also offering 
						the same opportunity.

						Today I continued with Smart Home LP for mobile, the biggest build I had worked on

						Today I worked on the Black Friday updates with the Content team. The Approach taken 
						to Black Friday was a slow release launch of promotions over a 2-week period, as opposed 
						to hourly drops on the day of Black Friday, thus allowing easier management of the event. 
						During this 2-week period there would be daily drops of products arriving at midnight, 
						with the day of Black Friday containing 5 large product drops throughout the day.<br />
						It was important that the Brands, Retail Trading and Content teams were all available 
						during this period as updates to product stock statuses meant that individual products 
						were added and removed frequently, along with the requirement for promotional banner updates.<br />
						There was a significant amount of responsibility on the Content team, required to provide maximum 
						support for the Black Friday updates. This involved 24 hour support the day of the event, and availability 
						to perform changes at all times by at least one member of the team for the whole 2 weeks leading up to the event. 
						This varied between being on call, remaining available to work from home if necessary, or in office, working in the ‘War’ room. <br />
						Today I worked with Paul & Sam, a on Black Friday updates. Helped to understand the processes involved in 
						updating both product lists, product deals and page headers/banners provided by trading and merch teams. 
						Use of Trello boards was very useful in managing the workflow of different tasks between teams, as it allowed 
						live updates to occur so content could be changed asap.

						Meeting with Ruth Richman to discuss data analysis<br />
						-	Data analysis plays an important role in the discovery tribe, focusing on quantitative data 
						that can be used to determine whether a project may go ahead or not. <br />
						-	E.g. with AB testing (50% of users view the original site, 50% view new solution), figures 
						are collected as to how users click on the site, ultimately leading to how this affects sale/revenue 
						figures and user activity.<br />
						-	A more recent example is when the ‘In stock/low stock’ flag below each product in all product 
						galleries was removed. This was AB tested, meant to last 15 days before a decision was made, however 
						after 8 days revenue was down 111k (along with other factors), of which the significant cause was identified 
						as the removal of the flag. This is because users began clicking away from pages and products, showing revenue 
						in the C&F department took the biggest hit (around 3%).
						<br /><strong>Afternoon</strong><br />
						Meeting with Lee Sommers and Jessica Crawford to discuss UX Research<br />
						-	RAD process flow from initial research ideas through to a final solution being developed and implemented.<br />
						-	Main stages of UX Research…<br />
						-	Discover, generate, evaluate, validate<br />
						-	Discover: understand customer behaviour, needs and trends<br />
						-	Generate: generate problems and opportunities within a narrowly defined scope<br />
						-	Evaluate: evaluate potential solutions for a known problem or opportunity<br />
						-	Validate: validate a final solution(s)<br />
						Flow of processes usually occurs in this order, however with some projects requiring greater demand, awareness of 
						projects may occur at the validation stage, so researchers may need to revisit earlier stages that the developers 
						haven’t considered in depth.<br />
						-	Also learned about different methods of research, both qualitative and quantitative techniques. This included user interviews, usability tasks and Guerrilla studies (going to different local locations and asking in person to perform some task).

						<br /><strong>Afternoon</strong><br />
						Meeting with Neil Blantern, the Business Analyst in the discovery tribe, to discuss his role & 
						responsibilities within the agile squad. <br />
						-	His role involves collecting information from other members within the squad to determine their progression in a ‘story’ 
						(project), so it can be determined whether the solution suggested is viable.<br />
						-	As a story progresses, the business analyst clears up any uncertainty and discusses what is possible to develop within 
						the given timeframes. Should a story yet be created, the business analyst will create a story for the project on Gera. This 
						will hold all information and clearly outline requirements, descriptions of designs, and location of assets.<br />
						-	The BA is typically invited to all meetings regarding a story at the early stages so they can voice what is possible, break down information overloads and determine the benefits it may have to the company. <br />
						-	Once a story has been created and agreed with developers, the BA passes the story onto developers.

						images on site. This can benefit both SEO, page loading speed via lazy loading, and 
						usability/navigational purposes. Luis spoke about rebuild and its impact on our way

						the ATG system currently in place is being replaced. He also spoke about snippets, 
						allowing for shortcuts to insert frequently used code. This template system will therefore

						styling shortcuts that will be added to the snippets file so that margins, heading sizes,

						Today I had a trial run of my presentation for the end of placement. This presentation 
						accounts for 15% of my overall grade for the year in industry, hence it was important 
						that I prepared as much as possible. Performing the presentation in front of Matt, Mike 
						and Jill allowed me to add in further valuable content to help ensure my academic advisor 
						fully understand my roles and responsibilities over the year.
